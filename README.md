# Letter Frequency Meter

![](LFM_128.png)

A text analysis tool, developed for postgraduate [TypeMedia](http://typemedia.org) course at the [Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague](http://www.kabk.nl). 

LetterFrequencyMeter generates a list of characters sorted by the frequency of use, and analyzes text according to its formal attributes. This version recognizes Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek characters.

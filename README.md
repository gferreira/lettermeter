# Letter Frequency Meter

![](LFM_128.png)

A text analysis tool, developed for postgraduate TypeMedia course at the Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague. LetterFrequencyMeter will generate a list of glyphs sorted by the frequency of use, and it will analyze text according to its formal attributes. This version will recognize Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek glyphs.
